Tutorials
=========

We offer tutorials to get you started with Hyperledger Mchain.
The first is oriented to the Hyperledger Mchain **application developer**,
:doc:`write_first_app`. It takes you through the process of writing your first
blockchain application for Hyperledger Mchain using the Hyperledger Mchain
`Node SDK <https://github.com/hyperledger/mchain-sdk-node>`__.

The second tutorial is oriented towards the Hyperledger Mchain network
operators, :doc:`build_network`. This one walks you through the process of
establishing a blockchain network using Hyperledger Mchain and provides
a basic sample application to test it out.

There are also tutorials for updating your channel, :doc:`channel_update_tutorial`, and
upgrading your network to a later version of Hyperledger Mchain, :doc:`upgrading_your_network_tutorial`.

Finally, we offer two chaincode tutorials. One oriented to developers,
:doc:`chaincode4ade`, and the other oriented to operators,
:doc:`chaincode4noah`.

.. note:: If you have questions not addressed by this documentation, or run into
          issues with any of the tutorials, please visit the :doc:`questions`
          page for some tips on where to find additional help.
