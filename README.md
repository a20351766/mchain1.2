## Hyperledger Mchain

Hyperledger Mchain is a platform for distributed ledger solutions, underpinned
by a modular architecture delivering high degrees of confidentiality,
resiliency, flexibility and scalability. It is designed to support pluggable
implementations of different components, and accommodate the complexity and
intricacies that exist across the economic ecosystem.

Hyperledger Mchain delivers a uniquely elastic and extensible architecture,
distinguishing it from alternative blockchain solutions. Planning for the
future of enterprise blockchain requires building on top of a fully-vetted,
open source architecture; Hyperledger Mchain is your starting point.
